## Dominic McDonnell      [Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Skills](#skills)

I am a curious and deep-thinking individual who is enthused by learning (both my own and others), science, technology and sport. I have achieved a number of things both personally and professionally, but my greatest achievement is that I have facilitated the learning of hundreds of young people in my time as teacher. I am currently focussing on my own learning as a Junior Developer. With the 'tool-box' of skills, knowledge, TDD and AGILE practices from Makers I am keen to take up new role.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have very strong verbal and non-verbal communication skills, developed and refined over many years in teaching.

- Confident public speaker, with the ability to adapt language and approach to best connect with audience.
- I have spoken and communicated with a range of different stakeholders; from school governors, parents and external bodies/visitors.

#### Time Management and Planning

Due to the nature of my previous jobs I have had to constantly work to deadlines to ensure that I am fulfilling my role.

- Ensuring that exam entires and coursework was assessed and submitted in a timely manner for students to be awarded qualifications.
- Plan and deliver the curriculum across the whole school over a period of an academic year.

#### Critical Thinking

- In my roles as a Head of Department, and as a Section 2ic in the Reserve Forces (Army) I have had to learn to prioritise tasks and make decisions based on the information at hand.
- This can also be evidenced through the management of departmental finances to ensure the best value is sought without compromising the integrity of the education delivered to students.
