[Education](#education) | [Experience](#experience) | [Skills](#skills)

I am a curious and deep-thinking individual who is enthused by learning (both my own and others), science, technology and sport. I have achieved a number of things both personally and professionally, but my greatest achievement is that I have facilitated the learning of hundreds of young people in my time as teacher. I am currently focussing on my own learning as a Junior Developer. With the 'tool-box' of skills, knowledge, TDD and AGILE practices from Makers I am keen to take up new role.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have very strong verbal and non-verbal communication skills, developed over many years in teaching and refined during my time at Makers. I can communicate my ideas and thought processes in an effective way, but also accept other methods of finding a solution. This was incredibly useful when pair programming. During group projects, we made use of tools such as Slack, stand-ups and retros to communicate progress, successes and blockers.

#### Time Management and Planning

Due to the nature of my previous roles I have had to constantly work to deadlines to ensure that I am fulfilling my role. Most recently, I have used resources such as trello and waffle.io to facilitate tracking issues/tasks during projects, but also getting weekend challenges finished for the Monday morning pull request deadline whilst balancing a personal life.


#### Critical Thinking

Whilst at Makers Academy this discussion, decision making and coaching centred on finding creative ways to find a solution or a more effective and elegant way to refactor code produced. In my roles as a Head of Department, and as a Section 2ic in the Reserve Forces (Army) I had to prioritise tasks and make decisions based on the information at hand. An example would be the management of departmental finances to ensure the best value is sought without compromising the integrity of the education delivered to students.
