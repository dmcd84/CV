## Dominic McDonnell

I am a curious and deep-thinking individual who is enthused by education/learning (both my own and others), science, technology and sport. I have achieved a number of things both personally and professionally, but my greatest achievement is that I have facilitated the learning of hundreds of young people in my time as teacher. 

After helping so many others, I am now focusing on my own learning journey by grasping the unique opportunity to attend Makers Academy and undertake the ultimate upskill in my own knowledge and skills. With the 'tool-box' of skills, knowledge and Test Driven Development from Makers I am keen to embark on a new career in the tech industry.

## Transferrable Skills

#### Communication

I have very strong verbal and non-verbal communication skills, developed and refined over many years in teaching.

- Confident public speaker, with the ability to adapt language and approach to best connect with audience.
- I have spoken and communicated with a range of different stakeholders. From school governors, parents and external bodies/visitors.This can be evidenced in the training I led for both staff and parents on E-Safety in my role as Head of ICT
- I am also very comfortable communicating with the public, as was a large part of my role when working in security with the Amry Reserves at the 2012 London Olympics.
- I have also had to analyse exam data and report back to stakeholders such as the Headteacher and Senior Leadership about which the progress of different demographics of students within the cohort.

#### Time Management and Planning

Due to the nature of my previous jobs I have had to constantly work to deadlines to ensure that I am fulfilling my role.

- Ensuring that exam entires and coursework was assessed and submitted in a timely manner for students to be awarded qualifications. 
- Plan and implement the curriculum across the whole school over a period of an academic year.
- Deliver content to students within the alloted time frame.

#### Crictical Thinking

- In my roles as a Head of Department, and as a Section 2ic in the Reserve Forces (Army) I have had to learn to prioritise tasks and make decisions based on the information at hand. 
- This can also be evidenced through the management of departmental finances to ensure the best value is sought without compromising the integrity of the education delivered to students.
